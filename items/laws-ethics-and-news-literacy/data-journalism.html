						<h1>Data Journalism</h1>
						<p>As a computational/data journalist, I have experimented with three different data visualization softwares: Infogram, Datawrapper, and Tableau. I am also now fluent in the language of excel sheets. I use the visualizations to present my findings in an aesthetically pleasing way, and develop my data analysis in the article itself to help the reader make sense of the most important pieces of data along with its implications. Through data, I maintain journalistic integrity and construct richer stories by allowing readers to get the full picture as well as dive deeper into the data and make their own inferences and discoveries.</p>
					</header>
					<h3>The Process</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Gather data</li>
						<li>Select pieces of data that are most relevant to the article</li>
						<li>Craft data visualizations using the appropriate software and visualization type</li>
						<li>Analyze the data trends</li>
					</ol>
					<h3><a href="https://www.tableau.com" target="_blank">Tableau</a></h3>
						<p>Tableau is my favorite data visualization software because of its ability to create really powerful visualizations <b>and</b> conduct data analysis. The following are a few of my favorite data journalism articles.</p>
						<p><i>Click <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/stuti.gupta7945#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0" target="_blank">here</a> to view all of the dashboards I created using Tableau.</i></p>
						<ul>
							<li><h4>Unmasking mental health during the pandemic</h4></li>
							<p>Data helps me find unique stories. By looking at my school county’s budget documents and comparing the trend of their depression-related funding to national adolescent depression trends, I am able to hold my county accountable for their response to the otherwise unaddressed mental health of adolescents. Gathering data from the U.S. Census Bureau, SocialPro, and my county's budget documents, this article took me a total of one month to compose.</p>

							<li><h4>Two words better taken out</h4></li>
							<p>I used Tableau in my opinion article covering the necessity of the Pledge of Allegiance to give my readers a broader understanding of how my viewpoints compare to others nationally. I gathered this data from the Pew Research Center and Gallup Polls.</p>

							<li><h4>Return to school survey results released <b>&</b> Return to school frequently asked questions and survey results</h4></li>
							<p>Though these two articles do not contain much data analysis, I wrote them in response to inquiries from other students who were struggling to decide whether they should remain virtual or go to school in-person once given the choice.</p>
							<p><i>Click <a href="https://www.tjtoday.org/29150/news/return-to-school-survey-results-released/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.tjtoday.org/29206/news/return-to-school-frequently-asked-questions-and-survey-results/" target="_blank">here</a> to read the story.</i></p>

						</ul>
					<h3><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de" target="_blank">Datawrapper</a></h3>
						<p>I first learned of Datawrapper after speaking with a <a href="https://alexanderlim.io" target="_blank">data journalist</a> at The New York Times. I found Datawrapper’s User-Interface to be very sleek and easy to use. However, I dislike how it is not possible to have several visualizations in one dashboard, as is possible with Tableau.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><h4>Jefferson receives “AP Computer Science Female Diversity Award”</h4></li>
							<p>This article answers the driving question: who were the key people and actions involved in helping Jefferson achieve the “AP Computer Science Female Diversity Award” from the CollegeBoard? The data visualizations in this article cover the national progression of women holding certain college degrees over time, the national percent of students who took AP Computer Science Principles in high school and later majored in computer science in college, and the percent of girls in each of the Jefferson computer science classes from 2012-2020. I always include localized data to make the story more compelling and relevant to my audience. I received a "Best of SNO" award for this article.</p>

						</ul>
					<h3><a href="https://infogram.com" target="_blank">Infogram</a></h3>
						<p>Though Infogram is easy to use, I am somewhat disappointed in how it compares to Tableau and Datawrapper in terms of both the ability to display complex graphics, and its User-Interface while creating the visualizations.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><h4>Put your money where your value is</h4></li>
							<p>I wrote this article for <a href="https://girlgeniusmag.tech" target="_blank">Girl Genius Magazine</a>, a student-run nonprofit centered around inspiring women in STEAM. This article utilizes data to compare the differences between generations, and deeply dives into data analysis in the text itself.</p>
