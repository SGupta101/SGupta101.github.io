								<h2 class="major">My path as a computer scientist.</h2>
								<p>As a computer scientist, I’ve explored my interest through courses such as Data Structures & Functional Programming and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, I’ve gained many fundamental skills through working on projects in hackathons and internships. For instance, this summer, I was a SWE intern at Google working on internal tool that allows user to communicate with machines in data storage centers. During previous summers, I’ve worked as a Human-Computer Interaction research intern at George Mason University, and as a SWE intern at digital advocacy tech startup Phone2Action. As I continue my journey, I can’t wait to contribute to the world of tech and meet many talented people along the way.</p>

								<h2 class="major">My path as a journalist.</h2>
								<p>It wasn’t until I joined tjMedia my sophomore year of high school that I discovered my love for journalism. Over the years, I’ve continued to explore this passion as Editor-in-Chief of my high school newsmagazine senior year and a news reporter throughout college. My favorite part about writing is learning about and sharing the perspectives of different people and communities. I especially enjoy writing data-focused articles as I believe that data is a powerful tool that can help create a more accurate and “bigger picture” view of the story. I am currently working on a story for the Cornell Daily Sun on faculty diversity and how it has changed over the years, drawing in data on the faculty build-up across universities. </p>

									<h2 class="major">How my two paths led me to computational journalism.</h2>
									<p>As I continued on the path through both fields, I soon realized I didn't have to choose just one.</p>

										<h3 class="major">What is computational journalism?</h3>
										<p>Computational journalism is the mix between journalism, algorithms, and data to better gather and display information while delivering more accurate news, without bias. Computational journalism can unravel complex stories in a more efficient and understandable way, and encourages better journalism and less political polarization.</p>
										<h3>Algorithmic Reporting</h3>
										<h3>Data Visualizations</h3>
										<h3>Fact-checking</h3>

									<div class="span-3">
										<h4>Why computational journalism is important to me.</h4>
										<p>Especially during confusing times like these, with rampant disinformation and political polarization, it's important for journalists to continue reporting while also maintaining trust with their readers. With <b>computer science</b>, I can use tools such as data analysis to give readers a better sense of the big picture, and algorithms to better understand bias in the news we read. With <b>journalism</b>, I can better understand others' perspectives and effectively communicate ideas.
										<h4>What I've done in computational journalism.</h4>
										<p>With Tableau, I’ve investigated stories such as mental health funding at my high school and the advisor-student ratio per school at my university. Through an individual research project during my senior year of high school, I also built a website that analyzes event selection bias across news outlets using text analysis, machine learning, and data visualizations to compare the ways in which various news outlets report on specific events.</p>
